Java can be used for mobile developement, Web developement and Enterprice developement

file name and class name can be different but while compiling you should enter file name then it will create .class file of class name and u should run with the class name.(Compile with file name, Run with class name)

Compiler Just checks only syntax

JDK,JRE,JVM (PPT\1.png){
    JVM is an abstract, it is not physically exist
    Java is platform independent but JVM  is platform dependent

    We have a machine to make java Platform independent we went for a virtual layer doesn't matter which machine u have JVM the idea is to have JVM on every machine
}

Public Static Void Main (String args[]){
    Public - Public it is a access modifier, JVM should be able to call this method out side of the class.
    Static- Creating Space, it is the 1st one to load, it allows to call without creating a object of a class in which a main method is defined.
    Void- Doesn't return any value.
    Main - Main method is static.
    Main method is statcu because object is not created but still it is loaded

    if the method is static no need of ref variable u can directly call that method like (Ref\1.png).
    if you are making a non static method without reference u cannot access.So to make that happen we have to make a referece of that class and then  call the method with that referece that we created. (Ref\2.png)

    String args[] is arguments that we pass in main method.
    args is just a name u acn keep anything there. (Ref\3.png)
    arguments passes in String type.
    args[] is a array type variable which we can call as object of string.
    We use this String args[] when we want to pass information, even if we dont want to pass information we should include because it is a part of syntax.
}

To see the source code u can enter javap (classname). (Ref\4.png)
it is also called as java dissabmler.

In JVM you have 2 types of memory 1.Stack Memory(1st in-last out) 2.Heap Memory. (Ref\5.png) 
Stack Store memory in Key(name of the variable) and Value(value of the variable). (Ref\6.png)
Check this. (Ref\7.2.png)line20 is not object it is a referece variable.So when we say new Claculator it will create a new object inside the heap memory. 
Local variables are a part of a Stack,Instace variables are a part of Heap.
Even the add method also sotres in Heap(it actually sotres the definition of add), but the actuall area that add will consume is Stack Memory. (Ref\8.png) 
And that address of the object that created in heap memory is stored in the front of obj. (Ref\9.png)
So that we can say there is a link between stack and heap, it will search for the add

Wrapper Classes means converting primitive into object and object into primitive{
    int --> Integer
    char --> Character
    long --> Long
    autoboxing-->primitive to object
    unboxing --> object to primitive
}

We can change the value of static variable i.e it will take the updated value. (PPT\7.png)for ans check output only

Datatypes (Ref\10.png)
Character can be incremented by using integer (Ref\11.png)
literals are the values that are given to the variables

%
    if the numerator is smaller than the denominator it will always give the value of numerator.

Type Casting
If it is happening automatically it is converting.
Doing is Explicitly it is Casting.
Implicit TypeConversion - Small to Big. 
Explicit TypeCasting - Big to Small.
We cannot store Character value into Boolean value, Because Boolean supports only True and False.
From int to byte it will perform Modulus of that num by 256 and give remainder as output.
Java supports type promotions i.e; it the result is out of byte it will promote it to integer. (Ref\12.png)
Check this.(Ref\13.png) it behaves differently when u try to assign/fetch a value to it 

Ternary Operator Check this(Ref\14.png)

Switch Case:
To not to use break statements we can use arrow or yelid (Ref\17.png)(Ref\16.png)
Using switch case as expression (Ref\15.png)

Check this (Ref\18.png).

While loop loops till it returns false(while loops return ture or false)
    it runs till the condition is false
Do-While will always excecute once either the condition is true or false.
    So if we want the loop to excecute atleast once then we can use this loop.
    end the loop with semicolon(;).
    in the do block u should include increment or decrement operator or else it will go to infinite loop.
for
    to use for loop as while loop u can use two semicolon's(Ref\19.png)

if you know how many iteration you want to run then you can use For loop
if you want to read a file or database u can use while loop.
if u want the loop to run atleast once then u can use do while loop
